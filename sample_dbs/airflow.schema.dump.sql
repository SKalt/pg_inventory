-- 
--       "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
--       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
--       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

--       "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
--       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
--       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

-- 
--       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
--       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
--       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
--       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
--       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
--       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
--       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
-- 
--       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
--       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

--       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

-- 
--       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
--       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
--       subsequently incorporated within the Work.
-- 
--    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
--       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
--       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
--       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
--       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
--       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
-- 
--    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
--       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
--       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
--       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
--       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
--       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
--       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
--       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
--       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
--       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
--       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
--       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
--       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
--       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
--       as of the date such litigation is filed.
-- 
--    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
--       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
--       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
--       meet the following conditions:
-- 
--       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
--           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
-- 
--       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
--           stating that You changed the files; and
-- 
--       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
--           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
--           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
--           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
--           the Derivative Works; and
-- 
--       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
--           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
--           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
--           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
--           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
--           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
--           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
--           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
--           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
--           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
--           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
--           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
--           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
--           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
--           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
--           as modifying the License.
-- 
--       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
--       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
--       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
--       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
--       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
--       the conditions stated in this License.
-- 
--    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
--       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
--       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
--       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
--       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
--       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
--       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
-- 
--    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
--       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
--       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
--       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
-- 
--    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
--       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
--       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
--       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
--       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
--       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
--       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
--       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
--       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
-- 
--    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
--       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
--       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
--       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
--       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
--       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
--       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
--       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
--       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
--       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
--       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
-- 
--    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
--       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
--       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
--       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
--       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
--       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
--       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
--       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
--       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
--       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
-- 
--    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-- 
--    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

-- 
--   Additional Grant of Patent Rights Version 2
-- 
--   "Software" means the RocksDB software distributed by Facebook, Inc.
-- 
--   Facebook, Inc. ("Facebook") hereby grants to each recipient of the Software
--   ("you") a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable
--   (subject to the termination provision below) license under any Necessary
--   Claims, to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise
--   transfer the Software. For avoidance of doubt, no license is granted under
--   Facebook's rights in any patent claims that are infringed by (i) modifications
--   to the Software made by you or any third party or (ii) the Software in
--   combination with any software or other technology.
-- 
--   The license granted hereunder will terminate, automatically and without notice,
--   if you (or any of your subsidiaries, corporate affiliates or agents) initiate
--   directly or indirectly, or take a direct financial interest in, any Patent
--   Assertion: (i) against Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or corporate
--   affiliates, (ii) against any party if such Patent Assertion arises in whole or
--   in part from any software, technology, product or service of Facebook or any of
--   its subsidiaries or corporate affiliates, or (iii) against any party relating
--   to the Software. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Facebook or any of its
--   subsidiaries or corporate affiliates files a lawsuit alleging patent
--   infringement against you in the first instance, and you respond by filing a
--   patent infringement counterclaim in that lawsuit against that party that is
--   unrelated to the Software, the license granted hereunder will not terminate
--   under section (i) of this paragraph due to such counterclaim.
-- 
--   A "Necessary Claim" is a claim of a patent owned by Facebook that is
--   necessarily infringed by the Software standing alone.
-- 
--   A "Patent Assertion" is any lawsuit or other action alleging direct, indirect,
--   or contributory infringement or inducement to infringe any patent, including a
--   cross-claim or counterclaim.
